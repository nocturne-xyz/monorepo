# Changelog

### Unreleased

- `syncSDK` returns latest synced merkle index so fe-sdk can access and return
- sync adapters return latest synced merkle index
- `syncSDK` takes `SyncOpts` as params, add `timeoutSeconds` to `SyncOpts`
- remove all usage of winston logger except for in sync adapters (so we can debug test actor and snap)
- fix bug where notes with 0 value were being stored in DB
- refactor OperationMetadata to be structured
- add db test that ensures getMany doesn't returned entries for `undefined` values
- add `flatten`, `flatMap` to `ClosableAsyncIterator`
- add `collect`, `chain`, and `tapAsync` to `ClosableAsyncIterator`
- 20% buffer on sdk gas price
- wrap fetch requests in `async-retry` with exponential backoff
- fix bug in ignore indices that caused zero (dummy) notes to make sdk incorrectly ignore note at merkle index 0
- pass in optional winston logger
- remove some unnecesary logs that are left-over from debugging sessions.
- we fail to take into account extra joinsplit gas if gas asset is not already in joinsplits, we fix that in tryUpdateJoinSplitRequests
- we keep using `opRequest.joinSplitRequests.length` instead of `simulatedOp.joinSplits.length`, causes ops with > 500k worth of joinsplit verification/handling to fail
  - Fix uses simulated op joinSplits.length for gas estimation and lowers per joinSplit gas estimate
- sync through current block, not merely up to it
- add `getLatestIndexedBlock` to `SyncAdapter` and make `syncSDK` use that instead of `provider.getCurrentBlock()`
- fix `hasEnoughBalanceForOpRequest`
- fix sdk bug where using simulation maxNumRefunds was causing "too many refunds" revert
- fix edge case that can cause totalEntityIndex to go backwards in subgraph sync adapter
- sync `SDKEvent`s instead of notes and nullifiers individually
- rename `getCreationTimestampOfNewestNoteInOp` to `getCreationBlockOfNewestNoteInOp` and make it return block number instead of timestamp.
- make `NocturneDB` version itself via `TotalEntityIndex` instead of block number
- replace `WithTimestamp` with `WithTotalEntityIndex`
- sync by `TotalEntityIndex` instead of block ranges
- add dedicated module for `TotalLogIndex` and `TotalLogIndexTrait`
- `sdk.updateOptimisticRecords` now follows pattern of getting all opDigest records then going from opDigest -> opDigestRecord -> merkleIndices -> nfRecords and removing all expired/completed op digest and nf records
- change `NullifierChecker` and `BundlerNullifierChecker` to be `OpTracker` (since we now poll all info about op digest and nf records solely based on op digest)
- add methods to `NocturneDB` for storing/getting/removing op digest records
- move optimistic record types out of nocturne db into `types.ts`
- add unit tests to ensure no note re-usage and that op request builder consolidates js requests
- make creating joinsplits for js requests sequential instead of `Promise.all` + keep running list of used note merkle indices (to avoid reusing notes in same op and therefore NF conflicts)
- fix off by one error in gatherNotes which allowed us to accidentally reuse same note
- ensure checksum addressed used when storing items in DB
- ensure chain id and deadline are populated in wallet sdk
- add build with chain defaults method to `OperationRequestBuilder`
- optimsitically track nullifiers
  - store `merkleIndex -> OptimisticNFRecord` mappings in `NocturneDB`
  - refactor "getNotes" methods to take `GetNotesOpts`, which allows caller whether or not they want to include uncommitted notes and/or ignore optimistic NFs
  - add methods `applyOptimisticNullifiersForOp` and `updateOptimisticNullifiers` to `NocturneWalletSDK`, which the wallet can call to update the NF cache when it sees fit.
  - add `NullifierChecker` interface
- subgraph sync checks if `res.data` undefined
- add ElGamal encryption for canonical addresses and use in joinsplit PI generation code
- use `CompressedStealthAddress` in `EncryptedNote` and refund addr

- change note commmitment / hash functions to avoid potential collision using new compressed encoding
- add `CompressedStealthAddress` and methods for compressing / decompressing points and stealth addresses
- modify joinsplit indexing after removing fields from joinsplit event
- export subgraph sync fetch methods so subtree-updater can use for its own adapter
- fix off-by one bug in RPC sync adapter last committed merkle index
- RPC syncing uses joinsplits and refunds instead of insert note events
- add `emptyNote` method to `NoteTrait` in anticipation of 0 nullifier gas optimization (not nullifying empty note slots)
- add method `getCreationTimestampOfNewestNoteInOp` to SDK that allows frontends to display privacy indicators or warnings based on "age" of the notes being spent
- track creation time (in unix millis) of all notes stored in `NocturneDB`
- add `op.gasAssetRefundThreshold` functionality (opRequestGas converts 200k gas \* gasPrice into gas asset and fills gasAssetRefundThreshold field)
- sort joinsplits by encodeAsset to get gas saving in processJoinSplits
- move rest of tree constants into `treeConstants.ts`
- change `nextMerkleIndex` to `lastCommittedMerkleIndex` in NocturneDB
