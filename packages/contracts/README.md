## How to Run Deploy Script Locally

1. Ensure the desired network has an entry in `hardhat.config.ts`. You can simply copy an existing network and replace the network name (key) url env var.
2. Populate a `.env` file. `HARDHAT_NETWORK` should match the name of the network populated in `hardhat.config.ts`.
3. Run `yarn deploy` to run the script.
