# Changelog

### Unreleased

- change spend key derivation to `keccak256(bip44Node.privateKey)`
- remove custom gas est call in snap and let sdk handle
- `nocturne_sync` takes and propagates `SyncOpts` as params
- remove use of winston logger
- fix bug where snap was parsing op metadata as `.metadata` not `.opMetadata`
- setup browser logger for SDK to use
- add method to fetch all inflight op digests and metadata `nocturne_getInflightOpDigestsAndMetadata`
- parse metadata param in `nocturne_signOperation` method and pass to `applyOptimisticRecordsForOp` call
- lock snaps-cli to finalized version `0.32.2` (https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/discussions/1411)
- apply op's nullifiers to SDK's optimsitic nullifiers at the end of `nocturne_signOperation`
- update SDK's optimistic nullifiers after each sync
- call `loadNocturneConfigBuiltin("localhost")` instead of copying config from `config` package into snap
- throw error when `snap_dialog` returns a falsy value (unlike `snap_confirm`, `snap_dialog` doesn't do this for you);
- snap slurps up real config - not dummy config - using JSON module
- Snap takes handler contract addr for SDK not wallet
- if op doesn't have `gasPrice` set, set it to chain's current gas price
- set `gasAssets` in `DUMMY_CONFIG`
- use new `NocturneWalletSDK` instead of `NocturneContext`
- make `SnapKVStore` only dump on writes by putting the inner KV store in a thunk
- use `SubgraphSyncAdapter` against local graph node
- call `context.sync()` at the beginning of `nocturne_signOperation` so it's unnecessary for frontend to explicitly sync
- remove `syncLeaves` method and rename `syncNotes` to `sync` (only one `sync` method)
