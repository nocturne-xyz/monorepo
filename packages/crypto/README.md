# crypto-utils

> DISCLAIMER: this library is an ongoing WIP. It currently only contains a subset of circomlibjs' functionality. It hasn't been audited, so use it at your own risk.

This library contains some non-constant-time implementations of primtives needed for input generation when working with circom. For us, it serves as a typed alternative to `ffjavascript` and `circomlibjs` that builds in a metamask snap and saves us a lot of development headaches.
